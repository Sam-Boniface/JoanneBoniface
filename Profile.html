			<h1> About Me </h1>
			<p>
			My strengths in design concepts, presentations, project scheduling and budgeting ensure that my client service is excellent and helps me thrive in a challenging and creative position. <br><br>
			I excel in residential and commercial space planning and have a keen eye for colour schemes, accessories and attention to detail. <br><br>
			I pride myself in designing a space that reflects the home owner and the things they hold dear. This approach ensures my client is happy with my service, which reflects well as recommendations are often made to their friends, family and co-workers. My organisational, interpersonal and motivational skills propel projects to peak results. <br><br>
			I have excellent knowledge using AutoCAD, all Microsoft Office packages, Adobe Photoshop and a variety of internal systems. I am currently learning to use Vector Works, Sketch Up and Adobe InDesign. <br><br>
			My previous experience in Kitchen Design coupled with my enthusiasm and dedication to achieving success drives me forward, looking for a new challenge and to learn new skills for interior design.
